I am a PhD student in the program in Speech and Hearing Bioscience and Technology (SHBT) at Harvard University and advised by Dr. Josh McDermott at the Laboratory of Computational Audition at BCS, MIT. I am interested in everything hearing and brain. My research focuses on understanding auditory perception following hearing impairment and applying those insights in developing improved hearing prosthetics. During Fall'21, I worked in the Puria Oto-biomechanics Lab at Mass. Eye and Ear where I helped in developing Simulation based Inference models for predicting finite element model parameters of mammalian middle and inner ear. During Spring'22, I was affilaited to Nakajima Lab where I developed middle ear microphones for fully-implantable cochlear implants. Before coming to Harvard in 2021, I received my Bachelors in Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering at Jadavpur University, India where I was working on developing drones with hearing capabilities.

Current Research
================

In spite great success, current cochlear implants still fail to restore fully normal hearing perception, possibly (1) because of the suboptimal signal processing strategies (2) the brain pathway may not be able to adapt itself completely to the altered peripheral representation. Through developing neural network models of cochlear implant mediated auditory perception, my research aims to unveil the factors underlying the limitations of the current devices and help explore the space of optimal signal processing and stimulation strategies for improving the device performance. 

Previous Research
=================
## Simulation based Inference for Finite Element Model Parameter Estimation
As a Fall 2021 rotation student in the Puria Otobiomechanics Lab, Mass. Eye and Ear, I helped in developed a Simulation Based Inference (SBI) model to estimate the parameters of Finite Elememnt (FE) models of gerbil middle ear and cochlea. I also analyzed the sensitivity of the estimated parameters using standard error functions. 

## Development of Middle Ear Microphones for Fully Implantable Cochlear Implants
As a Spring 2022 rotation student in Nakajima lab, Mass. Eye and Ear, I was involved in developing and testing novel umbo (centre part of the ear drum) microphones that can be used for a fully-implantable cochlear implant. 

Apart from Research
====================
Other than research, reading, experimentation, I am also very passionate about teaching, mentoring, science communication activities. I serve as the Mentoring Co-Chair in the Executive Board of Harvard Graduate Women in Science and Engineering (HGWISE) where we match graduate students with mentors from academia and industry to guide them in their desired career paths. 

When not busy with research, I love to go for short walks and easy hikes; listen to music; workout (a little bit); dance (a lot!); and exlore Cambridge and Boston.
