I am a PhD student in the program in Speech and Hearing Bioscience and Technology (SHBT) at Harvard University and advised by Dr. Josh McDermott at the Laboratory of Computational Audition at BCS, MIT. I am interested in everything hearing and brain. My research focuses on understanding auditory perception following hearing impairment and applying those insights in developing improved hearing prosthetics. Before coming to Harvard in 2021, I received my Bachelors in Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering at Jadavpur University, India where I was working on developing drones with hearing capabilities.
